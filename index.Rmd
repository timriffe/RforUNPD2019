# Aim
The aim of this workshop is to provide solid foundations for demographers to use `R` for functional programming. The course will cover best practice principles about writing reproducible code that follows contemporary conventions, how to organize and structure code for more complex and repetitive tasks, break up code into reusable functions, catch errors, and debug.

A day will consist in interactive demonstration lasting around 3 hours in the morning, and exercises demonstrating concepts in afternoon. Troubleshooting will take place throughout. Participants should have the most recent versions of `Rstudio` and `R` installed.

3. alternatives to for-loops
4. More on writing functions & debugging
5. operating on groups

[Session 5](Day5) (Friday, 23 Aug)

1. R markdown for legible reproducibility
2. tidyverse concepts 
3. DDSQLtools workflow with tidyverse
4. errors, bugs, and feature requests for DemoTools or DDSQLtools
5. review 

### Week 2
The second week is dedicated for advanced users/programmers.

1. Focus on `DemoTools` and `DDSQLtools` with systematic and comprehensive applications to `MS-SQL DemoData` empirical data for population by age and sex, vital events and rates.
2. Use of `git` and `github` for code repository and teamwork.
3. One or two data visualization lectures.
